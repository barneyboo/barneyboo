### well hello.
I'm a senior developer in BBC News Labs - I work on experimental audience-facing formats, and tools to make life better for our journalists. It's pretty fun!

### what am i working on now?

#### ü¶∏üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏ègraphical storytelling
We're building a new format for building visually compelling health stories for social platforms, without needing to be a designer.

Last year, [we wrote](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/news/2020/graphical-storytelling/) about some of our initial experiments with generating visual panels with nothing more than natural text written by a journalist. And this year, with health stories being more important than ever, we're working on getting this into production. I've been tech lead for our latest 6 week investigation, building the journalist-facing tooling, and renderers for the stories themselves. I'll have more to share on how these stories are looking soon...


### what have i done before?

#### üó≥ SALCO - semi-automated stories for NHS performance and elections

Lots of news stories are driven by data, and for the last couple of years we've been looking at using public data to generate stories we otherwise couldn't, starting with hyperlocal stories about A&E performance in your local NHS trust. For the 2019 general election, we gave the tech our most ambitious outing yet - generating stories in English for each of the UK's 650 constituencies as they were declared, and another 40 in Welsh. I've been responsible for building the journalist-facing tooling and data processing pipelines for these initial pilots.
