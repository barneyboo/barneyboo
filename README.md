### well hello.
I'm a senior developer in BBC News Labs. I've been working on experimental audience-facing formats, and tools to make life better for our journalists since 2017. It's pretty fun!

### what am i working on now?

#### üå≤ Evergreen Content
Building on our work with Depth Finder (below), we've started investigating ways of helping our editorial teams quickly identify appropriate evergreen content to recommend to audiences as soon as a new story breaks or trends. More on this soon....


### what have i done before?

I've been lucky to work on loads of really interesting and high impact projects in News Labs. All of these have been huge team efforts, both within Labs and across the BBC, so here's some examples of what I've been able to contribute...

#### üåç Live Page Translation - making language services' journalism travel further
The BBC has dozens of international language services that produce great journalism for audiences around the world, including several underserved languages. Original journalism from these services could often benefit a wider audience, but stories often don't travel well between services because of a lack of visibility to other parts of the organisation, and of course, language barriers.

We've built a dashboard that aggregates stories in real time from any number of services, and optionally only for particular topics, and automatically translates them into the language of a user's choice. Now our journalists can follow breaking stories, and quickly reversion the content for their own audience, reducing duplication of effort within the BBC and better serving our international audiences.

#### ü¶∏üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èGraphical Storytelling - high impact stories for underserved audiences
We're building a new format for building visually compelling health stories for social platforms, without needing to be a designer.

Last year, [we wrote](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/news/2020/graphical-storytelling/) about some of our initial experiments with generating visual panels with nothing more than natural text written by a journalist. And this year, with health stories being more important than ever, we're working on getting this into production. I've been tech lead for our latest 6 week investigation, building the journalist-facing tooling, and renderers for the stories themselves. I'll have more to share on how these stories are looking soon...

#### ‚ùìExplainer Builder - making complex stories accessible
Whether it's elections or coronavirus, a lot of stories are complicated, fast-changing, and can expect a lot of background knowledge from audiences. We've created the Explainer Builder to let journalists easily create and maintain Q&As for the BBC News website. We've created BBC-wide knowledge bases around certain topics that journalists can update and use to create embeddable explainers, with the option of answering questions as they're typed by audiences. In our first tests, the impact of this format was huge, and in [March I spoke to journalism.co.uk](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/bbc-news-experiments-with-explainer-feature-to-help-readers-make-sense-of-complex-stories/s2/a753374/) about our motivation for the format.

#### üó≥ SALCO - semi-automated stories for NHS performance and elections
Lots of news stories are driven by data, and for the last couple of years we've been looking at using public data to generate stories we otherwise couldn't, starting with hyperlocal stories about A&E performance in your local NHS trust. For the 2019 general election, we gave the tech our most ambitious outing yet - generating stories in English for each of the UK's 650 constituencies as they were declared, and another 40 in Welsh. I've been responsible for building some of the journalist-facing tooling and data processing pipelines for these initial pilots.

#### üåä Depth Finder - surfacing the best of the BBC's evergreen content
The BBC produces lots of high impact analysis, explainers, and in-depth long-reads. These stories often have a better shelf life than on-the-day journalism, so we want to make sure we can get the best value from these stories by getting them in front of audiences who want to read them. Depth Finder is a search engine specifically for such content. Now our journalists can instantly see whether there's a relevant piece on any topic, in any language, so they can easily include them as onward journeys in their own work, to make this content go further. I designed and built the frontend for Depth Finder, and since its introduction its queryable elasticsearch archive of BBC News stories has gone on to power several other prototypes and experiments.

#### üí¨ Crossing Divides - helping create better conversations
For the BBC World Service's Crossing Divides season, we built an interactive storytelling format, to help audiences navigate difficult conversations from two different perspectives. The result is a challenging set of stories, which was shortlisted for the Association of International Broadcasting‚Äôs Innovation Award in 2018.

#### üêô Octo - quick transcripts from BBC media
Journalists often need quick transcription of their content - whether it's the recording of a long interview, or a finished package to put together subtitles. Octo pulls together a bunch of existing integrations with our audio and video content systems, and our internal speech-to-text services, to offer a consistent way of getting transcripts from any BBC media. One of my first projects in News Labs, I built Octo's React frontend.
