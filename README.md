### well hello.

ðŸ‘‹ I'm a senior developer at News UK, building the new CMS for The Times and The Sunday Times. Before that, I spent four years working for BBC News Labs to build innovative editorial tools and audience-facing formats.

### open source things

I maintain a few forks of open source projects, usually with small feature updates/fixes:

**[@barneyboo/VlcMedia](http://github.com/barneyboo/VlcMedia)** - Unreal Engine 4 plugin for streaming media via libVLC. This fork adds support for volume control.

**[@barneyboo/react-autosuggest](https://github.com/barneyboo/react-autosuggest)** - React component that provides autosuggest behaviour. This fork adds support for tabbing on a suggestion to act as confirmation of a selection.
