### well hello.

ðŸ‘‹ Most recently I was working at News UK, building the new CMS for The Times and The Sunday Times. Before that, I spent four years working for BBC News Labs to build innovative editorial tools and audience-facing formats. Now I'm going it alone!

### iOS apps

**[Jourza](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jourza/id1630377412)** - Generates random flight plans for flight simulation use

**[Arli](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arli-endless-random-numbers/id1635548739)** - Mix and match dice, random numbers, and random text pickers



### open source things

I maintain a few forks of open source projects, usually with small feature updates/fixes:

**[@barneyboo/VlcMedia](http://github.com/barneyboo/VlcMedia)** - Unreal Engine 4 plugin for streaming media via libVLC. This fork adds support for volume control.

**[@barneyboo/react-autosuggest](https://github.com/barneyboo/react-autosuggest)** - React component that provides autosuggest behaviour. This fork adds support for tabbing on a suggestion to act as confirmation of a selection.
