### well hello.
I'm a senior developer in BBC News Labs. I've been working on experimental audience-facing formats, and tools to make life better for our journalists since 2017. It's pretty fun!

### what am i working on now?

#### ü¶∏üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏ègraphical storytelling
We're building a new format for building visually compelling health stories for social platforms, without needing to be a designer.

Last year, [we wrote](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/news/2020/graphical-storytelling/) about some of our initial experiments with generating visual panels with nothing more than natural text written by a journalist. And this year, with health stories being more important than ever, we're working on getting this into production. I've been tech lead for our latest 6 week investigation, building the journalist-facing tooling, and renderers for the stories themselves. I'll have more to share on how these stories are looking soon...


### what have i done before?

I've been lucky to work on loads of really interesting and high impact projects in News Labs. All of these have been huge team efforts, both within Labs and across the BBC, so here's some examples of what I've been able to contribute...

#### ‚ùìExplainer Builder - making complex stories accessible
Whether it's elections or coronavirus, a lot of stories are complicated, fast-changing, and can expect a lot of background knowledge from audiences. We've created the Explainer Builder to let journalists easily create and maintain Q&As for the BBC News website. We've created BBC-wide knowledge bases around certain topics that journalists can update and use to create embeddable explainers, with the option of answering questions as they're typed by audiences. In our first tests, the impact of this format was huge, and in [March I spoke to journalism.co.uk](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/bbc-news-experiments-with-explainer-feature-to-help-readers-make-sense-of-complex-stories/s2/a753374/) about our motivation for the format.

#### üó≥ SALCO - semi-automated stories for NHS performance and elections
Lots of news stories are driven by data, and for the last couple of years we've been looking at using public data to generate stories we otherwise couldn't, starting with hyperlocal stories about A&E performance in your local NHS trust. For the 2019 general election, we gave the tech our most ambitious outing yet - generating stories in English for each of the UK's 650 constituencies as they were declared, and another 40 in Welsh. I've been responsible for building some of the journalist-facing tooling and data processing pipelines for these initial pilots.

#### üí¨ Crossing Divides - helping create better conversations
For the BBC World Service's Crossing Divides season, we built an interactive storytelling format, to help audiences navigate difficult conversations from two different perspectives. The result is a challenging set of stories, which was shortlisted for the Association of International Broadcasting‚Äôs Innovation Award in 2018.

#### üêô Octo - quick transcripts from BBC media
Journalists often need quick transcription of their content - whether it's the recording of a long interview, or a finished package to put together subtitles. Octo pulls together a bunch of existing integrations with our audio and video content systems, and our internal speech-to-text services, to offer a consistent way of getting transcripts from any BBC media. One of my first projects in News Labs, I built Octo's React frontend.
